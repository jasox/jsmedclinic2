INVEST Criteria
---------------
The INVEST criteria for requirement stories was developed by Bill Wake. 
Stories should be compared to the criteria of independent, negotiable,
valuable, estimable, small, and testable.

•Independent 
means that each story can be completed by itself, without dependencies on other stories. 
Often a sequence of stories exists, such as the check-out and check-in stories. 
Some people term this sequence a saga. Although there is a relationship between 
the stories, check-out can be completed by itself, and later the check-in story can be done. 
But it could be harder to do the stories in reverse (check-in first and then check-out.)

•Negotiable 
means that the triad has not made a hard and fast determination of exactly what is 
in the story. They will collaborate on that when they start working on the story.

•Valuable 
means that the story has a business value to the customer. That’s one reason the customer 
should put a business value on each story. If a story cannot be ascribed a business value, 
perhaps it should not be done. Any developer story that is created should relate to 
some story to which there is an assigned business value.

•Estimable 
implies that the developer and tester can come up with some sort of rough estimate 
as to how long it will take to complete the story. If they lacked knowledge about 
the business domain or were implementing the story in some completely new technology, 
they might not be able to give an estimate. If the customer needed a rough estimate 
to justify spending money on the story, the developer would spend some time investigating 
the domain or the technology.

•Small 
stories can be completed in a single iteration or in a reasonable cycle time. 
If a story cannot be completed in a single iteration, it’s hard to track progress, 
and chances are it is too big a story to comprehend easily. Preferably, big stories 
(which some people call epics) are broken into smaller stories, each of which 
the customer can understand. Otherwise, the triad may need to break down the stories 
into developer stories to facilitate coding. 

•Testable 
means that the user can confirm that the story is done. Having acceptance tests makes 
a story testable, and passing those tests shows that the system meets the customer needs. 
Having acceptance tests that can be automated ensures that previous stories are not 
broken when new stories are implemented.
